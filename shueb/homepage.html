            <h3> New project underway to help address rough sleeping in Coventry</h3>
            Jim Crawshaw, the Head of Housing and Homelessness at Coventry City Council said that already a rough sleeping co-ordinator had been appointed and is due to start in a week, while outreach workers will link with other agencies specifically to improve partnership working in helping rough sleepers into accommodation.

A scheme to provide housing and support to more than 100 rough sleepers is also already underway, and a forum also is in place to link agencies together to share the best approaches to working with people sleeping on the street.
